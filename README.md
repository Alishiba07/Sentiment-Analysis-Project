# Sentiment-Analysis-Project
Description:
This project trains and compares five machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, and LSTM) for sentiment analysis on a dataset of online reviews.

Dependencies:
Ensure the following libraries are installed:
pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, nltk, joblib, matplotlib, seaborn

Instructions:
Load and preprocess the dataset (CSV with Review and Sentiment columns).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the five models and evaluate their accuracy.
Models will be saved as .pkl or .h5 files. Use joblib.load() to reload them.

Output:
The accuracy of each model will be displayed, allowing for model comparison.
