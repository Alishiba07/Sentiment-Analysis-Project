# Sentiment-Analysis-Project
This project compares five models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, and LSTM) for sentiment analysis on online reviews. Key steps include loading and preprocessing the dataset, splitting it, training models, and evaluating accuracy. The models are saved as .pkl or .h5 files, and their performance is compared. Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, nltk, joblib, matplotlib, seaborn.
